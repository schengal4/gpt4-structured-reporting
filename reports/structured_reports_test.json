Multiplanar reformations were also reviewed.FINDINGS: Pancreatic tumor: There is a 3.5 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm hypodense mass in the pancreatic head, which demonstrates mild heterogeneous enhancement on arterial and venous phases. The mass causes mild upstream dilation of the pancreatic duct, measuring up to 4 mm in diameter. There is no pancreatic parenchymal atrophy.Metastatic disease: Multiple liver lesions are identified, the largest being in segment VIII, measuring 2.3 x 1.8 cm, with arterial enhancement and washout on the venous phase, consistent with metastatic deposits. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation is observed. There are enlarged peripancreatic, porta hepatis, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.8 x 1.3 cm. No pelvic or retrocrural lymphadenopathy is detected. No suspicious lung nodules or pleural effusions are noted.Vascular involvement: The pancreatic mass encases the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and partially compresses it, with less than 50% narrowing of the vessel lumen. The main portal vein, splenic vein, and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) are patent and not encased by the tumor. No signs of cavernous transformation are observed.Thrombosis: No thrombus is identified within the portal vein, SMV, splenic vein, or inferior vena cava (IVC).Anatomy: The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys demonstrate normal size, shape, and enhancement pattern. No renal or ureteral calculi are detected. The gallbladder, appendix, and bowel loops are unremarkable. No free fluid or air is observed in the abdominal or pelvic cavities.IMPRESSION: Hypodense mass in the pancreatic head, measuring 3.5 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm, consistent with a pancreatic neoplasm.

The multiparametric prostate MRI was performed to monitor the known prostate cancer. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, including diffusion, T2, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging of the prostate. The post-contrast images were obtained following the uneventful intravenous administration of 8 mL of gadobutrol (Gadavist) gadolinium-containing contrast. COMPARISON: ( )FINDINGS: The prostate gland is mildly enlarged measuring 4.2 x 4.8 x 4.7 cm (volume 42 mL). There are no suspicious lesions or abnormal signal intensity in the peripheral zone of the prostate gland. However, a small focal area of low T2 signal intensity is seen in the right transition zone measuring approximately 6 mm in diameter, which has increased in size compared to the prior study. The area shows restricted diffusion on the ADC map, with a value of 912 x 10^-3 mm^2/s. In addition, there is a focal area of T2 hypointensity in the left base peripheral zone, measuring approximately 7 mm in diameter, which has remained stable. The ADC value for this area is 1235 x 10^-3 mm^2/s. The dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) characteristics show diffusely enhancing area with plateau-type kinetics in the right transition zone, with a PI-RADS v2 score of 4. On the other hand, the left base peripheral zone has mildly enhancing area with gradual wash-in and washout kinetics, with a PI-RADS v2 score of 3. IMPRESSION: Based on the above findings, there is no evidence of suspicious lesions or significant changes in the peripheral zone of the prostate gland compared to the prior study. However, the small focal area of low T2 signal intensity in the right transition zone has increased in size compared to the prior study, with a PI-RADS v2 score of 4. This suggests a possible progression of the previously diagnosed prostate cancer in the right transition zone, requiring further evaluation and monitoring.

A multiparametric prostate MRI was performed to assess the possibility of extraprostatic extension. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, including diffusion, T2, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging of the prostate. The post-contrast images were obtained following the uneventful intravenous administration of 8 mL of gadobutrol (Gadavist) gadolinium-containing contrast. FINDINGS: The prostate gland measures 4.1 x 4.3 x 4.6 cm (volume 42 mL). There is a focal area of T2 hypointensity in the left mid-gland measuring approximately 11 x 9 mm in diameter. The area shows restricted diffusion on the ADC map, with a value of 890 x 10^-3 mm^2/s. The dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) characteristics show focal enhancing lesion with washout kinetics in the left mid-gland, with a PI-RADS v2 score of 5. The area shows capsular abutment and is likely associated with extraprostatic extension. No other suspicious lesions or abnormal signal intensity are seen in the peripheral zone of the prostate gland. IMPRESSION: Based on the above findings, a focal area of T2 hypointensity with restricted diffusion and washout kinetics on DCE suggests the presence of clinically significant cancer in the left mid-gland with a PI-RADS v2 score of 5. The capsular abutment and likely extraprostatic extension of the lesion is concerning for prostate cancer invasion into surrounding tissues. This finding requires further evaluation and monitoring for possible treatment options.",

The DCE results show a PI-RADS v1 DCE score of 2 and a PI-RADS v2 DCE LCA continue score of negative. The overall PI-RADS v1 Lesion Summary Score is 4, and the PI-RADS v2 Lesion Summary Score is 4. The peripheral zone of the prostate demonstrates uniform high signal intensity on T2 without additional abnormalities on diffusion or postcontrast imaging, suggesting it is likely benign. The central gland exhibits a well-encapsulated whorled appearance, consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia, also indicating that it is likely benign. Examining the remaining abdomen and pelvis, the lung bases are clear, and no pleural or pericardial effusions are observed. The liver appears normal in morphology and signal intensity, with no focal liver lesions identified. Conventional hepatic arterial anatomy is present, and the hepatic, portal, and superior mesenteric veins are patent. No intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation is present, and the gallbladder is normal without gallstones. The pancreas, adrenal glands, and spleen are normal. Bilateral small renal cysts are noted, measuring up to 17 mm in the right kidney, with no solid mass or hydronephrosis observed. The bowel appears normal. The bladder is trabeculated, consistent with chronic bladder outlet obstruction and diverticulosis. The visualized aorta is normal in caliber, and the IVC is patent. No enlarged lymph nodes are detected in the abdomen or pelvis, and no free fluid is seen in the abdomen or pelvis. Multilevel degenerative changes of the spine are noted. IMPRESSION: Lesion L1 in the mid region of the central gland of the prostate is suspicious for prostate cancer, with a PI-RADSv1 category 4 and PI-RADSv2 category 3.

FINDINGS: Mild joint effusion in the right knee. The medial meniscus showed a horizontal tear at the posterior horn, while the lateral meniscus appeared intact. Both the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were intact, as well as the medial and lateral collateral ligament complexes. The popliteus tendon and posterolateral corner structures were also found to be intact, with the capsule showing no surrounding edema. The extensor mechanism, including the quadriceps and patellar tendons, appeared unremarkable. The articular cartilage was intact, and bone marrow signal intensity was normal. There was no evidence of a Baker's cyst or pes anserine bursitis. However, a mild degeneration of the medial patellar retinaculum was observed, which could be the source of the patient's discomfort. IMPRESSION: In summary, the MRI findings indicate a horizontal tear at the posterior horn of the medial meniscus and mild degeneration of the medial patellar retinaculum.

CTDI vol (mGy): 279. DLP (mGycm): 1258. FINDINGS: Limited visualization of the lower thorax demonstrates clear lung fields. Liver, spleen, adrenals, and pancreas are unremarkable. Both kidneys demonstrate normal size and parenchymal attenuation. No renal lesions or hydronephrosis. Gallbladder is present with no gallstones or wall thickening. The small and large bowel caliber is within normal limits. No mesenteric adenopathy or ascites. The bladder is partially filled with no intraluminal mass or wall thickening. No evidence of prior bowel resection. No hernia or hip arthroplasty. Mild degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine. CTA: The caliber of the visualized thoracic and abdominal aorta is within normal limits. Moderate atherosclerotic plaque is present in the abdominal aorta. The celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery are patent without significant stenosis. Both renal arteries are patent without significant stenosis. Both internal and external iliac arteries are patent with moderate atherosclerotic plaque bilaterally. Moderate atherosclerotic plaque is seen within both common femoral arteries. The proximal superficial femoral arteries demonstrate severe stenosis bilaterally. Severe stenosis is also observed within Hunter's canal for both right and left superficial femoral arteries. Both popliteal arteries demonstrate severe stenosis. In the lower calves, there is severe disease. The right anterior tibial artery is occluded with only faint distal reconstitution. The right posterior tibial artery demonstrates severe stenosis, while the right peroneal artery is occluded. On the left calf, the left anterior tibial artery and the left posterior tibial artery are both occluded with minimal distal reconstitution. The left peroneal artery demonstrates severe stenosis. IMPRESSION: Severe atherosclerotic disease in the lower extremities with bilateral occlusions and severe stenosis, consistent with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. Moderate atherosclerotic disease in the aortic and iliac arteries. No significant mesenteric or renal artery disease.",

The purpose of this examination is to assess for potential spinal pathology. COMPARISON: None. PROCEDURE: An MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine was performed before and after administration of 8 mL IV Gadavist contrast at 3 Tesla. Sagittal T2, STIR, T1, axial T2, and postcontrast axial and sagittal T1 sequences were obtained. FINDINGS: The alignment of the spine is normal. Diffuse degenerative changes are seen throughout the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, with disc desiccation, disc space narrowing, and osteophyte formation. Multilevel Schmorl's nodes are observed, particularly in the thoracic spine. A focal area of abnormal signal intensity and enhancement is noted within the T9 vertebral body, suspicious for an infiltrative lesion. This lesion causes moderate spinal canal stenosis and mild compression of the spinal cord without cord signal abnormality. Adjacent to the T9 lesion, there is a mild anterolisthesis of T8 on T9, causing additional spinal canal narrowing. The spinal cord and conus medullaris appear normal without any signal abnormalities or enhancement, apart from the mild compression at the T9 level. Moderate to severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis is observed at multiple levels in the cervical spine, secondary to a combination of uncovertebral joint hypertrophy, facet joint arthropathy, and disc bulges. The visualized extra-vertebral soft tissues appear unremarkable, and no abnormal enhancement is noted. IMPRESSION: Focal lesion within the T9 vertebral body, suspicious for an infiltrative process such as metastasis or infection, causing moderate spinal canal stenosis and mild compression of the spinal cord.

PROCEDURE: Multiplanar, multisequence imaging of the left hip was performed at 3T before and after the uneventful administration of IV gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: Extensive intra and extra-articular signal abnormality, consistent with the patient's history of PVNS. The abnormality originates from the right hip and extends into the ischiofemoral interval. It invades the proximal anterior compartment of the thigh anteriorly, infiltrates the adductors and obturator externus muscles medially, and extends into the gluteal musculature posteriorly. Laterally, the PVNS wraps around the posterior greater trochanter. The posterior margin of the PVNS is adjacent to the right ischial tuberosity and abuts the sciatic nerve without causing abnormal nerve signal. At the level of the ischiofemoral interval, the PVNS spans an area of approximately 17.4 x 13.8 x 9.6 cm (SI x transverse x AP), indicating a slight increase in size since the previous examination. There is bony involvement of the femoral head and neck, lesser trochanter, and acetabulum. Cortical erosion is present, which can be seen more clearly on the comparison radiograph. No acute pathologic fracture is identified. Mild peritendinous fluid is seen surrounding the distal iliopsoas tendon, which is otherwise intact. The hamstring and gluteal tendons are also intact. A small hip joint effusion is present, and mild articular cartilage loss is observed in the hip. Anterior labral degeneration and tearing are present. A few left inguinal lymph nodes are seen, measuring up to 1.1 cm in short axis, which are nonspecific and have slightly increased in size since the previous examination. Two small external iliac lymph nodes measure up to 0.7 and 1.0 cm, also showing a slight increase in size since the previous examination. The imaged pelvis appears normal, with no free fluid in the pelvic region.

Laterally, the PVNS wraps around the posterior greater trochanter. The posterior margin of the PVNS is adjacent to the right ischial tuberosity and abuts the sciatic nerve without causing abnormal nerve signal.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen/pelvis from __ PROCEDURE: The patient underwent a multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the abdomen and pelvis on a 3 Tesla magnet without intravenous contrast due to compromised renal function. FINDINGS: Upon reviewing the lung bases, no pleural or pericardial effusions were observed. The liver appeared normal in size and contour, but with two T2 hyperintense lesions in the left hepatic lobe. The largest lesion was found in segment 2, measuring 2.8 x 2.5 cm, consistent with metastatic disease. The biliary tree showed no signs of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation, and the common bile duct measured up to 4 mm in diameter. The gallbladder seemed unremarkable with no signs of wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, or cholelithiasis. The pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys showed no significant abnormalities. The spleen was unremarkable in size, shape, and signal intensity without any focal lesions. The abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava were within normal limits, with no evidence of aneurysm or dissection. The mesenteric vasculature appeared patent and unremarkable. No significant retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy was identified. The small bowel loops appeared normal without evidence of obstruction, dilation, or wall thickening. The large bowel demonstrated no focal abnormalities, and the anastomotic site from the prior sigmoid colectomy appeared intact and unremarkable. No intraperitoneal free fluid or free air was observed. In the pelvis, the prostate was moderately enlarged, consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia, but no suspicious lesions were identified. The seminal vesicles and urinary bladder appeared normal. There was no pelvic lymphadenopathy or ascites. The visualized portions of the pelvic musculature and bones appeared unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Two T2 hyperintense lesions in the left hepatic lobe, the largest measuring 2.8 x 2.5 cm in segment 2, consistent with metastatic disease in the setting of a known history of colon cancer. No evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. No signs of bowel obstruction, anastomotic complications, or significant lymphadenopathy.

The spleen reveals multiple small enhancing lesions consistent with metastases. The pancreas also shows several focal hypointense T2 lesions with enhancement, likely metastatic deposits. Bilateral adrenal glands exhibit irregularly shaped, enhancing masses, in keeping with adrenal metastases. Both kidneys are normal in size and demonstrate homogeneous enhancement, but there are a few small cortical lesions with restricted diffusion, suggesting metastatic involvement. The urinary bladder is unremarkable. Multiple enhancing lesions are visualized within the pelvic and abdominal musculature, consistent with metastatic disease. Additionally, enlarged retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and iliac lymph nodes are present, compatible with metastatic lymphadenopathy. Multiple osseous metastases are identified within the visualized spine, sacrum, and pelvis, characterized by increased T2 signal intensity and postcontrast enhancement. IMPRESSION: Widespread metastatic disease involving the liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, osseous structures, and soft tissues, consistent with the known history of metastatic malignant melanoma.

TECHNIQUE: The MRI examination was performed using coronal T1 and T2-weighted sequences, sagittal T1 and T2-weighted sequences, and axial T2 sequences, without intravenous contrast administration. No prior studies are available for comparison. FINDINGS: A skin marker is located on the left side of the neck at the level of the C5/6 intervertebral disc space. The cervical spine alignment appears normal. Vertebral bodies demonstrate preserved signal and height. Intervertebral disc spaces exhibit normal height, with moderate disc desiccation at C5/6 and C6/7 levels. There are mild disc-osteophyte complexes present at C5/6 and C6/7. Facet joints appear normal, and no spinal canal or foraminal stenosis is observed. The visualized spinal cord and posterior fossa display normal signal and contour, with no evidence of intra- or extradural mass lesions. A heterogeneous T1 and T2 hyperintense mass is identified in the left anterior cervical space, adjacent to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The mass measures approximately 2.8 x 1.8 x 4.2 cm in AP, lateral, and craniocaudal dimensions, respectively. The mass shows a predominantly fluid signal, suggesting a possible cystic lesion.

PROCEDURE: Field Strength: 3 T MRI Protocol Name: Cardiac Myocarditis Assessment Series Acquired: Axial T2-weighted imaging of the upper abdomen and the heart SAX & Cine imagine of the heart in multiple planes. FINDINGS: Normal size of both ventricles. Mild global hypokinesis of the left ventricle is noted, with an ejection fraction of 48%. No significant segmental wall motion abnormality. No obvious valvular regurgitation. A small pericardial effusion is present. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images demonstrate patchy areas of subepicardial enhancement in the lateral and inferolateral walls of the left ventricle, suggestive of myocardial inflammation. T2-weighted images reveal increased signal intensity in the lateral and inferolateral walls, consistent with myocardial edema. QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS Biometrics: 75.5 kg, 170 cm, BSA 1.89 m^2 Volume Quantification: RVEDV: 135 mL, 71 mL/m^2 RVESV: 55 mL, 29 mL/m^2 RVSV: 80 mL, 42 mL/m^2 RVEF: 59 % LVEDV: 180 mL, 95 mL/m^2 LVESV: 93 mL, 49 mL/m^2 LVSV: 87 mL, 46 mL/m^2 LVEF: 48 % IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of myocarditis with patchy areas of subepicardial enhancement in the lateral and inferolateral walls of the left ventricle, along with increased T2 signal intensity consistent with myocardial edema. Mild global hypokinesis of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 48%. Small pericardial effusion. RECOMMENDATIONS: Clinical correlation is advised to determine the relevance of these findings in relation to the patient's symptoms. Further evaluation and management of myocarditis should be discussed with the patient's healthcare provider, considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Follow-up cardiac MRI may be considered to monitor the resolution of myocardial inflammation and improvement of left ventricular function.",

Evaluation for possible hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is requested. TECHNIQUE: 3 Tesla MRI scanner. The study includes cine imaging in standard long-axis and short-axis views, T2-weighted imaging, T2* imaging, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences, and volumetric quantification measurements. FINDINGS: The left ventricle demonstrates asymmetric septal hypertrophy with a maximal wall thickness of 18 mm in the basal anteroseptal segment. The left ventricular ejection fraction is preserved at approximately 55%. The right ventricle appears normal in size and function. Mild aortic regurgitation is observed, and the other valves appear normal. No significant pericardial effusion is identified. Late gadolinium enhancement reveals patchy mid-myocardial enhancement in the hypertrophied septal segments, suggestive of myocardial fibrosis. T2-weighted images show no signs of myocardial edema or inflammation. T2* imaging reveals a myocardial T2* value of 32 milliseconds, indicating no significant myocardial iron overload. The atria are normal in size, and no intracardiac thrombus is detected.
